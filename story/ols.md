**OLS: Ostriches Leap Silly – The Hero of Regression City**

---

In **Regression City**, where predictions ruled daily life, a villain named **Chaos Variance** created havoc by distorting data and causing errors in forecasts. The city's balance was at risk, and no one could predict what would happen next.

But a hero emerged: **OLS**, short for **Ordinary Least Squares**, secretly embodied by a quirky ostrich named **Ordinary**. Ordinary had a unique power – the ability to **leap** into action and find the **best-fit line** between data points, minimizing errors and bringing back order to the city's predictions.

With the power of the **OLS formula**:

$$ \hat{y} = \beta_0 + \beta_1x $$

OLS could predict the future accurately by **minimizing the sum of squared residuals**:

$$ J(\beta) = \sum_{i=1}^{n}(y_i - \hat{y}_i)^2 $$

One day, **Chaos Variance** unleashed giant **outliers**, beasts that disrupted all predictions. But OLS fought back by calculating the **least squares solution**, dodging the outliers and reducing the errors. With each leap, OLS neutralized Chaos Variance's power, restoring balance to Regression City.

**OLS** became the legendary superhero of precision, known for defeating **Chaos Variance** and ensuring that the city's data and predictions were always **accurate**. The story of OLS – the ostrich with a silly leap – was forever remembered as the champion of order in Regression City.
