### Ordinary Least Squares (OLS)

#### Introduction
Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) is a method used to find the best line that fits a set of points on a graph. It helps us understand how one thing affects another.

#### Definition
OLS is a way to find the straight line (or equation) that best predicts the outcome (like test scores) based on another factor (like hours studied).

#### Formula
The formula for a simple linear regression line is:

\[
\hat{y} = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x
\]

Where:
- \(\hat{y}\) = predicted value (what we expect to get)
- \(\beta_0\) = intercept (the starting point of the line)
- \(\beta_1\) = slope (how steep the line is)
- \(x\) = the input value (like hours studied)

#### Explanation of Parameters
- **\(\hat{y}\)**: The value we predict (like a score).
- **\(\beta_0\)**: The point where the line crosses the y-axis (when \(x\) is zero).
- **\(\beta_1\)**: How much \(\hat{y}\) changes for each unit increase in \(x\).
- **\(x\)**: The independent variable (like hours studied).

#### Advantages
1. **Easy to Understand**: Simple method for finding relationships.
2. **Fast Calculation**: Works well with many data points quickly.
3. **Clear Results**: Coefficients are easy to interpret.

#### Properties (Props)
- Provides the best estimates under certain conditions (like normal distribution of errors).

#### Disadvantages (Cons)
1. **Sensitive to Outliers**: Unusual data points can skew results.
2. **Assumes Linearity**: Assumes a straight-line relationship which may not always be true.
3. **Multicollinearity**: Too much correlation between input factors can cause problems.

#### Applications
- **Education**: Predicting test scores based on study hours.
- **Economics**: Analyzing spending habits based on income.
- **Healthcare**: Understanding the effect of exercise on health outcomes.

### Example Problem
**Problem**: Predict the score of a student based on hours studied. 

| Hours (x) | Score (y) |
|-----------|-----------|
| 1         | 50        |
| 2         | 55        |
| 3         | 65        |
| 4         | 70        |
| 5         | 75        |

#### Step-by-Step Calculation
1. **Calculate Necessary Sums**:
   - \(n = 5\) (number of observations)
   - \(\sum x = 15\) (sum of hours)
   - \(\sum y = 315\) (sum of scores)
   - \(\sum xy = 1750\) (sum of hours times scores)
   - \(\sum x^2 = 55\) (sum of squares of hours)

2. **Calculate \(\beta_1\)** (slope):
   \[
   \beta_1 = \frac{n(\sum xy) - (\sum x)(\sum y)}{n(\sum x^2) - (\sum x)^2} = \frac{5(1750) - (15)(315)}{5(55) - (15)^2}
   \]
   \[
   = \frac{8750 - 4725}{275 - 225} = \frac{4025}{50} = 80.5
   \]

3. **Calculate \(\beta_0\)** (intercept):
   \[
   \beta_0 = \bar{y} - \beta_1 \bar{x} = \frac{315}{5} - 80.5 \times \frac{15}{5}
   \]
   \[
   = 63 - 241.5 = -178.5
   \]

4. **Final Equation**:
   \[
   \hat{y} = -178.5 + 80.5x
   \]

### Code Example (Python)
Here's how to implement OLS in Python:

```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Data
x = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])  # Hours studied
y = np.array([50, 55, 65, 70, 75])  # Scores

# Calculate coefficients
n = len(x)
beta_1 = (n * np.sum(x * y) - np.sum(x) * np.sum(y)) / (n * np.sum(x**2) - (np.sum(x)**2))
beta_0 = np.mean(y) - beta_1 * np.mean(x)

# Predicted values
y_pred = beta_0 + beta_1 * x

# Plotting
plt.scatter(x, y, color='blue', label='Data points')
plt.plot(x, y_pred, color='red', label='Regression line')
plt.xlabel('Hours Studied')
plt.ylabel('Score')
plt.title('Ordinary Least Squares Regression')
plt.legend()
plt.grid()
plt.show()

# Output coefficients
print(f'Intercept (β0): {beta_0}')
print(f'Slope (β1): {beta_1}')
```

### Where, How, and When to Use OLS
- **Where**: In studies involving predictions, like education or economics.
- **How**: Collect data, clean it, apply the OLS method, and interpret results.
- **When**: When you believe the relationship between variables is linear and you have enough data to analyze.

### Summary
OLS is a simple and effective way to predict outcomes based on other factors. It provides easy-to-understand results, making it valuable in various fields.

### Recap
- **Definition**: A method to find the best-fitting line in data.
- **Formula**: Equation of the line: \(\hat{y} = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x\).
- **Advantages**: Simple and fast.
- **Disadvantages**: Sensitive to outliers and assumes linearity.
- **Applications**: Used in education, economics, and healthcare.
- **Example**: Illustrates calculating coefficients with data.
